@file: test_balldontlie.py
@description:
Test module for validating the refactored Ball Don't Lie API service.
These tests verify that the service correctly integrates with the
balldontlie-api/python library and handles responses appropriately.

@dependencies:
- pytest: For test framework
- pytest-asyncio: For asynchronous test support
- app.services.ball_dont_lie_api: The module being tested

@notes:
- These tests require an internet connection to access the BallDontLie API
- Tests are marked to run with pytest-asyncio
- Tests may be affected by API rate limiting if run too frequently
- The tests use duck typing rather than importing specific model classes
